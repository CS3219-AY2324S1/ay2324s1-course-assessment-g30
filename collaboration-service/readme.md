# Prerequisites

1. Node.js: This project uses Node.js for server-side scripting. You can download and install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. npm (Node Package Manager): npm is bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately. You can check if npm is installed by running npm -v in your terminal.
3. Redis: This project requires Redis as a data store. If you don't have Redis installed, you can follow the instructions to install it [here](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

# Setup

1. Open a new Unix-based terminal window and start the redis server by running `redis-server`. By default, Redis runs on port 6379.
2. In the project directory, run `npm install`
3. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server
